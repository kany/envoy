h1. Envoy

This is meant to be a simple script to help open an ssh tunnel to act as a socks5 proxy on an Amazon EC2 instance.

h2. Usage

Here's a peek of how to use the script...

<pre>
  envoy [-k SSH_KEY] [-u SSH_USER] [-h SSH_HOST] [-p SSH_PORT] [-l LOCAL_PROXY_PORT] [-s]
</pre>

Default values used if the options are not passed are as follows...

SSH_KEY: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
SSH_USER: ec2-user
SSH_HOST: localhost
* Yes, that is localhost on purpose, so at least pass this option!
SSH_PORT: 22
LOCAL_PROXY_PORT: 1080

The command used to open the ssh tunnel is this...

<pre>
  ssh -N -D LOCAL_PROXY_PORT -i SSH_KEY SSH_USER@SSH_HOST -p SSH_PORT &
</pre>

To close an open tunnel, use the '-s' flag

<pre>
  envoy -s
</pre>

h2. Current Roadmap

What does the future hold for this script? Here's a few things in the near...

- Local config file to avoid CLI passing of consistent information.
- Verifying process is running before trying to kill it when stopping execution.
- Use of words alongside CLI flags.
- {start|stop|status} options for a more usable command interface.
