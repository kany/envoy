h1. Envoy

This was originally designed to be a simple script to help open an ssh tunnel to act as a socks5 proxy on an Amazon EC2 instance.

However, the script is certainly not limited to Amazon EC2. It can be used to open a tunnel to any server that accepts an ssh connection!

h2. Usage

Here's a peek of how to use the script...

<pre>
  envoy [-h] [-k SSH_KEY] [-u SSH_USER] [-d SSH_HOST] [-p SSH_PORT] [-l LOCAL_PROXY_PORT] [-t PROXY_TYPE] {open|close|help}
</pre>

Command options...

|open|Open a proxy using optional flags|
|close|Close a running proxy|
|help|Show the full help message|

Flags...

|-k SSH_KEY|Private key (default: ~/.ssh/id_rsa)|
|-u SSH_USER|SSH username (default: ubuntu)|
|-d SSH_HOST|Domain name or IP connecting to (default: localhost)|
||Yes, that is localhost on purpose, so at least pass this option!|
|-p SSH_PORT|SSH port on server (default: 22)|
|-t PROXY_TYPE|Proxy type (default: socks5)|
|-l LOCAL_PROXY_PORT|Local proxy port (default based on PROXY_TYPE)|
||socks5: 1080|
||http: 8080|
|-h|Basic usage info|

h2. Current Roadmap

What does the future hold for this script? Here's a few things in the near...

- Local config file to avoid CLI passing of consistent information.

Beyond the near?

- Rebuild the script in Ruby. Why? B/c I'm a Ruby developer and I think it's fun!
